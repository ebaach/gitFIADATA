first we need to load the packages
```{r}
library(rFIA)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```
then we can remotely add MS FIA data
```{r}
getFIA(c('MS'), dir = 'name', load = FALSE)

MS <- readFIA('name', inMemory = FALSE)

```
#next, lets try rFIA functions
biomass by plot grouping by stand origin
```{r}
#must first define db at fia 
biomass(db = MS)
#biomass by plot
bioplt<- biomass(MS, byPlot = TRUE, grpBy = "STDORGCD")

```
diversity by plot gropuing by stand origin
```{r}
div_plt<- diversity(MS, byPlot = TRUE, grpBy = "STDORGCD")
```
